The PowerPoint slide deck "Toronto_Services_REST_APIs.ppt"
has been automatically exported from Google Docs.

The original - and definitive copy - is accessible via:
http://docs.google.com/Presentation?id=dhhxxzq7_6hnt2kfgp&hl=en

That document is shared between (at least) Aron and Patrick,
and can readily be further shared.  It's also viewable publicly
(read-only) at:
http://docs.google.com/Presentation?id=dhhxxzq7_6hnt2kfgp

PowerPoint export notes:

This export resulted in some font issues - unrecognized
fonts and sizes - that had to be manually cleared up.

In addition, Google Docs Presentations may not
provide Master Slide functionality, so each slide's
graphics layout, fonts, etc. are independent.
