<!-- Use this file to drive local testing.  
     To run this file, do: 
          cd trunk/services/IntegrationTests
          mvn test -Dtest=XmlReplayDevTest
     Maven surefire will kick off XmlReplayDevTest.
     
     IMPORTANT :: DO NOT CHECK THIS FILE IN WITH ANY TESTS ACTIVE BELOW.
		  Make sure all tests are commented out, or better yet, moved to dev-all.xml .
		  This file should be modified locally and used instead of xml-replay-master.xml
		  when you are developing.  This file can be used to point at a controlFile 
		  and a testGroup, so you can test just one thing at a time, or a limited suite.
     
     You can find other tests to run in two places:
       The tests that get run on nightly: 
     	 xml-replay-master.xml
       The set of possible tests, including ones that don't work:
         dev-all.xml
