  collectionObjects.rng
  
  A schema defining the structure of an CollectionObject collection
  (list of multiple CollectionObjects).
  
  This schema includes all of its components, rather than referring
  to them via 'externalRef' references. As such, it can be used as the
  basis for generating a W3C XML Schema (XSD) schema, via
  James Clark's Trang utility (http://http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/trang.html).
  (Trang version 20081028 can't resolve such references.) 
  
  As a convenience, a 'rng-to-xsd.sh' script file, which trivially wraps Trang
  to generate XSD from a RELAX NG schema, is provided elsewhere in this distribution.

  This schema was created for the CollectionSpace system,
  http://www.collectionspace.org/
  
  It is written in the XML syntax of the RELAX NG schema language,
  http://relaxng.org/

    Sanjay has used a different naming convention in the Person prototype,
    which would be equivalent here to "collection-object-list-item", rather than
    to "collectionObjectListItem", as used below.
    
    We may want to standardize on use of CamelCase or hyphenated lowercase throughout, or
    else establish a convention for list items which is distinct from that convention.
